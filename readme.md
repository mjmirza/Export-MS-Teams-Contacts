Abstract:
This script is just a quick hack to export the owners and members of a team as a CSV file without administrator permissions.

Usage:
1. Open your team
  -- Open the following url (make sure to have it open in browser - NOT in the application)
  -- https://teams.microsoft.com/
2. Select "Manage team" from its menu
3. Select the "Members" tab
4. Expand the "Owners" and "Members and guests" sections
5. Make sure to scroll down to the end of the owners and members lists to include all of them in your export (As the members are loaded on demand)
6. Open your browser console
7. Copy and paste all the content of this script to the console and type "Enter"
8. The CSV file download should start automatically

ToDo:
- Parse tags to include them in the export
